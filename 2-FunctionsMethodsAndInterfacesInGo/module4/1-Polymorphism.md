# Polymorphism

- ability for an object to have different "forms" depending on the context
- example: `Area()` function
  - rectangle, `area = base * height`
  - triangle, `area = 0.5 * base * height`
- identical at a high level of abstraction
- different at a low level of abstraction

## Inheritance
